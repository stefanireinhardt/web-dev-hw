                             <h1>Song Lyrics</h1>
<p>I would be complex<br />
I would be cool<br />
They'd say I played the field before<br />
I found someone to commit to<br />
And that would be okay<br />
For me to do<br />
Every conquest I had made<br />
Would make me more of a boss to you</p>

<p>I'd be a fearless leader<br />
I'd be an alpha type<br />
When everyone believes ya<br />
What's that like?</p>

<p>I'm so sick of running<br />
As fast as I can<br />
Wondering if I'd get there quicker<br />
If I was a man<br />
And I'm so sick of them<br />
Coming at me again<br />
'Cause if I was a man<br />
Then I'd be the man<br />
I'd be the man<br />
I'd be the man</p>

<p>They'd say I hustled<br />
Put in the work<br />
They wouldn't shake their heads<br />
And question how much of this I deserve<br />
What I was wearing, if I was rude<br />
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves<br />
And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play<br />
I'd be just like Leo, in Saint-Tropez</p>

<p>I'm so sick of running<br />
As fast as I can<br />
Wondering if I'd get there quicker<br />
If I was a man<br />
And I'm so sick of them<br />
Coming at me again<br />
'Cause if I was a man<br />
Then I'd be the man<br />
I'd be the man<br />
I'd be the man</p>

<p>What's it like to brag about raking in dollars<br />
And getting bitches and models?<br />
And it's all good if you're bad<br />
And it's okay if you're mad</p>

<p>If I was out flashin' my dollas<br />
I'd be a bitch, not a baller<br />
They'd paint me out to be bad<br />
So it's okay that I'm mad</p>

<p>I'm so sick of running<br />
As fast as I can<br />
Wondering if I'd get there quicker<br />
If I was a man (you know that)<br />
And I'm so sick of them<br />
Coming at me again (coming at me again)<br />
'Cause if I was a man (if I was man)<br />
Then I'd be the man (then I'd be the man)</p>

<p>I'm so sick of running<br />
As fast as I can (as fast as I can)<br />
Wondering if I'd get there quicker<br />
If I was a man (hey)</p>

<p>And I'm so sick of them<br />
Coming at me again (coming at me again)<br />
'Cause if I was a man (if I was man)<br />
Then I'd be the man<br />
I'd be the man<br />
I'd be the man (oh)<br />
I'd be the man (yeah)<br />
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)</p>
