#### My Responses to Questions 13 & 14
The **div** element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.  

The **class** attribute groups _similar_ types of elements together by using the same name value.

The **id** attribute is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page.

The **span** element, much like the **div** element, is used to contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text.

**Alt text** offers an accurate description of the image or content so that it can be understood by screen reader software used for people with visual impairments as well as search engines.

#### My Work Cycle
My work cycle for this assignment was similar to that of my last two homework assignments (_Assignments 5 & 6_). This weeks assignment was confusing at times but I felt more confident the more I experimented with the new code elements.
