# Stefani Reinhardt's web-dev-hw
Repository for my Intro to Web Dev Homework

I am a returning student and originally attended the U of M in 2009.  Now, I work full-time for the City of Helena's Community Development Department as an Administrative Assistant III.  I'm an artist at heart and hope to garner the skills to create works at a professional level when I get my degree.
