When you send a request to a server and it sends you a collection of web content back, the **Browser** interprets the content and displays it on the page.

**Browsers I Currently Use:**

**1.** Mozilla Firefox\
**2.** Google Chrome

**Markup Languages**, such as *HTML*, are the foundation or structure of a page's content that allows for other embedded or attached aspects to that page like stylesheets or scripts.
