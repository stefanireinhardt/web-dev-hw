I visited **MySpace.com** on May 19, 2004 using [_The Wayback Machine_](https://archive.org/web/). It looked outdated with simple graphics and pixelated headings.  Today, the graphics are much more pleasing to look at such as having more color and embeded video that plays when you arrive on the main page.

The Git Module has been a work in progress for me.  The platform's appearance is unlike any I've used before so it has been challenging to read it properly and not get lost in the details.  I do find it is easier to use the more time I spend with it though. So far, I have learned how to sync my desktop app with the live web version.
