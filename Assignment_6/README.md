# Assignment 6
## Stefani Reinhardt

I generally come across **forms** on every website I visit these days.  Whether it's a blog, social media, or the _University of Montana_ [_website_](http://www.umt.edu/), I am often prompted to enter _usernames_, _passwords_, and _upload files_.

#### Form Elements & Examples
**Text** is used for entering a single line of text such as an _email address_ or _name_.  Like when you sign up for a monthly newsletter or login using a username and password on your favorite site.  

**Selections** are used when a user is prompted to select from a list of options such as through _radio buttons_ or _checkboxes_.  These could come in handy when filling out a form that has multiple choices.

**Button Input (_or Submit Buttons_)** are used when a user wants to _submit_ a completed form on a website such as through a _subscribe_ button or an _upload_ button.  These buttons are used after filling out online forms like a web survey, or uploading a new picture to your Facebook feed.

#### My Work Cycle
My work cycle for this assignment was similar to that of my last homework assignment (_Assignment 5_). I felt like there was a lot more to cover this time, and it took me longer to get through it all.  However, I did notice I was able to understand the lines of code a little better since it all seems to follow a similar format.
