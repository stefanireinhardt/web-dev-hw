# Assignment 8
## Stefani Reinhardt

I am new to HTML so it has been challenging at times, especially this assignment.  I think the most difficult thing for me was keeping my code clean so that I could easily edit elements as I worked.  

I am very excited to learn about the "design" aspect of **css**. I have website designs I've seen that have been very visually appealing to me and I'd really like to learn how to replicate them using **css**.

This assignment kicked my butt, I'm not even gonna lie.  It was challenging but I got through it.  It tool a LOT of patients and testing out different ideas.
