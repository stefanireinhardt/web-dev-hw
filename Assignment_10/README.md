# Assignment 10
## Stefani Reinhardt

**System Fonts** are those already installed on your local device and system.  

**Web Fonts** are custom fonts hosted on a server that do not have to be available on the user's device to appear.

**Web-Safe Fonts** are fonts that developers can count on being available by the system.  These include font families that both Windows and Mac should already have.

It's important to have a set of fallback fonts or font stack in case the user's browser doesn't recognize your main font(s) and can automatically adjust itself to your second font of choice to ensure your design elements carry through despite the browser being used.

This assignment was difficult in that I struggled writing my codes correctly to get my chosen fonts to appear on my live site.  Once I figured it out though, it was just a matter of finding font sets that looked good together. I also found it very difficult to find fallback fonts that would closely match my main "medieval" themed font choice. But, I wanted a font that matched the time period of the speech I chose for my content.
