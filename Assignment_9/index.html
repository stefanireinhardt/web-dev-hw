          <p>Known for its vibrant floral patterns and colors, the 1960s is synonymous with the "<i>Flower Child</i>" or Hippie era. The movement arose when Americans became more outspoken in their opposition to the Vietnam War and embraced the flower symbolism to express their desire for peace and non-violence.  Below are some examples of how this movement impacted high fashion such as <i>VOGUE Magazine.</i></p>
