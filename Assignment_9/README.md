The **universal selector** is used to style _every_ element on a page. The **universal selector** is the star (\*) and is often used in computer science to mean “all.” One might use this one over the **element selector** if they want to keep the same paragraph or text format throughout the webpage and don't desire a change between sections.

The **element selector** is used to select all elements of a certain type such as **h1**.  This selector could be utilized to keep the same style format for a single element  like a header to differentiate between it and the content as well as create a certain flow.

The **class selector** matches an element whose class attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the period (.) symbol.  The **class selector** is similar to the **element selector** in that it allows a user to target an element or section and apply a certain set of attributes.

Just like the **class selector**, the **ID selector** allows developers to define style rules for a specific element by calling its unique ID. ID names are prepended with a number sign (#).

I pulled the following three colors from a 60s [_print_](https://meganmcnulty.nl/) and _VOGUE_ photograph I found online and used their hex codes in my css stylesheet:

**1.** Light Bluish Purple (Background): #636caa\
**2.** 60s Burnt Orange (Element Background): #e65525\
**3.** Mustard Yellow (Container Border): #fec52e

For this assignment, I researched old _VOGUE_ articles from the 1960s.  Once I found three pictures I liked, I opened them in Photoshop and used my color picker tool to pick my three colors and their Hex codes.  For the "_Flower Power_" header graphic, I made it in Photoshop and exported it as a .PNG to help tie in all my colors.
