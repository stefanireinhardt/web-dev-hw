 This assignment was difficult.  It took me a really long time to get to the final result I ended with.  I'm still not sure why I couldn't get my quote to float left to the edge of my div element, but it worked out.  My work cycle for this project included researching different websites where I found an interesting color scheme for a fish supplier.  I found an image of seafood and the rest is history.
