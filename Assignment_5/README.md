# Assignment 5
## Stefani Reinhardt

A page can _only_ have one **head** element and one **body** element.  The **head** element contains the information about the page such as the author's information and publication date, otherwise referred to as "_the thoughts of the page._" The **body** element contains all the content that will be visible within the browser window.

**Structural Markups** embed information about the structure of a document and includes elements such as _headings_, _paragraphs_, _breaks_, and _lists_.

**Semantic Markups** are used to reinforce the meaning of the information such as placing _emphasis_ on a word or phrase.  They also offer the ability to cite quotes, link to definitions, or distinguish editorial changes.

For this assignment, I followed along on the external [Intro-Web-Dev](https://intro-web-dev.media-ed-online.com/) website and then I would pause to read the specified pages from my _HTML&CSS Textbook_ when prompted.
