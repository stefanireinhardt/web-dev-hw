Assignment 12
## Stefani Reinhardt

My "Client" was Glacier International Park. They wanted a site that highlighted the park's picturesque landscape and animals.

Display **Inline** forces elements to act like inline elements.  Inline elements only take up as much horizontal space as needed and do not force new lines.

Display **inline-Block** removes new lines inherent in block elements.  They also force elements to respect margin and vertical spacing properties.

Display **Block** can be used to turn 'block' elements into **inline** or **inline-block** elements.  It can also be used to turn **inline** elements into **block** elements such as vertical menus out of lists.

My process for this assignment was a LOT of trial and error.  I had to work with the new elements such as **z-indexes** to really get the hang of them.  But, I feel more confident after working with them.
