Assignment 13
## Stefani Reinhardt

Before this class I didn't know much about coding in general and nothing about html or css coding. This class taught me a lot about web development and web design.  I am excited to take another class.

My work cycle for this assignment - like the rest - was a lot of trial and error.  I went out of my comfort zone and looked up additional codes that were not taught in this class to get the desired effects I wanted.  I am very happy with how it turned out, but I plan to keep adding to it after this class too.
